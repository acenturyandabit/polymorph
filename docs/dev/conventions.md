# Principles
1. Concat-extensibility: I should be able to extend the functionality of polymorph by just concatenating another function to the end of it.
    - This means no lists of pre-defined operators. Operator declarations are decentralised across each file.

# Conventions
- Outerdiv > innerDiv
- Internally, always pass containerIDs, rectIDs rather than live containers or rects.
    - As a result, containers and rects must enforce their place in polymorph_core ASAP.
    - Externally (for operator instantiation), we pass a container object, because that's easier to work with and reduces code duplication.
- Expect `undefined` return on failure.
- snake_case for variables.
- camelCase for functions.
