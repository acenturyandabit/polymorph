        <h1>Time syntax</h1>
        <p>
            Polymorph uses a custom date parser which allows users to enter complex time expressions in a single line of text.

            Here are some examples:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Value</th>
                    <th>Meaning</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>(5/8/19|+1w 9:00am>+3h|13)</td><td>Starting from 5/12/19 not inclusive, every 1 week over 13 weeks, the event runs from 9:00am to 12:00pm.</td>
                    <td>(5/8/19|+1w 9:00am>7:00pm|13)</td><td>Starting from 5/12/19 not inclusive, every 1 week over 13 weeks, the event runs from 9:00am to 12:00pm.</td>
                </tr>

lmfao
to convert from a datestring to a static date in js:
polymorph_core.items[id][property].datestring = new Date(polymorph_core.items[id][property].date[0].date).toLocaleString() + ">" + new Date(polymorph_core.items[id][property].date[0].endDate).toLocaleString()

to force a date reparse:
prop.date = dateParser.richExtractTime(prop.datestring);









            </table>
        </p>
        <h1>Itemcluster tips</h1>
        <p>
            If an item is in a particular view, itemcluster will enforce a property __itemcluster_[name-of-view] = true.
            In this way, you can make an itemlist display the items visible in an itemcluster in a pinch.

            Here are some examples:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Value</th>
                    <th>Meaning</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>(5/8/19|+1w 9:00am>+3h|13)</td><td>Starting form 5/12/19 not inclusive, every 1 week over 13 weeks, the event runs from 9:00am to 12:00pm.</td>
                    <td>(5/8/19|+1w 9:00am>7:00pm|13)</td><td>Starting form 5/12/19 not inclusive, every 1 week over 13 weeks, the event runs from 9:00am to 12:00pm.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>
