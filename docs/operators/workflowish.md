# Workflowish
Workflowish copies many concepts from Workflowy. Workflowy is a recursive bullet list system which allows collapsing of the bullet lists, allowing huge amounts of information to be recursively indexed.

## Usage
To load a workflowish operator, create a new tab, and then press "Workflowish" under the standard operators.
### Entering new items
- On any existing line, you can press `Enter` to add a new item.
- If you want to break an existing line in two, you can press `Alt/Option` + `Enter`.
- If you want to create a new subitem under the current item, you can press `Shift` + `Enter`.
- If you want to break an existing line in two, and then put that line under the existing one as a subitem, you can press `Alt/Option` + `Shift` + `Enter`.
### Modifying items
- Click and type in any item to modify it.
- To rearrange items, press `Alt` then `Up Arrow` or `Down Arrow` to move the currently selected item up or down.
- To indent an item, press `Tab`. To un-indent an item, press `Shift` + `Tab`.
- To show or hide child items, press `Ctrl` + `Down` or `Ctrl` + `Up`.

## Known issues
- If you have a lot of top-level items (on the order of thousands), Polymorph may struggle to load them all. Putting top-level items below subitems will increase the load speed.
