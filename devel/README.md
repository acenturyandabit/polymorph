## Keeping it straight
Polymorph doesn't use React or Angular or Vue. This means that anyone who knows javascript can contribute; there are no dependencies to install; and code isn't obfuscated*, meaning you can edit it during runtime from the browser.

Polymorph doesn't need to run on a server, just a browser; and Polymorph will be always open source. This means anyone can fork, clone and edit, and mod to their heart's content. 

Source code is in `/src`, and is divided by functionality.
