    <h1>Polymorph's organisational ethos</h1>

    working for the interface.

    As a consequence of this, polymorph is segmented as follows:

    Yes, the user-chooses ethos does come at the cost of the initial inconvenience of setting up a workflow, but
    polymorph does its best to make the process simple for the user.

    Definitely have a play around, and see which operators you prefer! Also check out the tutorial, accessible from the
