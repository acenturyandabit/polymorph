# Polymorph
Extensible project management tool. Made specifically so you can extend it with your own extensions; and port others' extensions into your workflow as well!

Because the best things in life are shared.

4. To use it immediately for yourself, change the index.html.
6. To share it with us all, submit a pull request with all your source code in the extensions/ directory...
7. ...or drop us a link where we can find your extension's minified .js file!

For instructions on how to make an extension, check out the template, and you can use any of the existing extensions as a guide.
Happy creating!
