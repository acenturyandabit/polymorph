## Problem
I like to rehash my task management tools as things come up - if I decide that there's a better way of managing my tasks that works for ME, then I want to be able to rebuild it. Sound familiar? I bet every developer or aspiring developer has a task management system that they've built or contributed to before because it just 'isn't quite right for them'.

## Solution
This project's for you then. Polymorph leverages the power of javascript to enable a modular and ridiculously customisable base for making the management tool that works for you.

## The ask

### I love the task management app I'm using now, but there's just a little thing on my mind...
Let me know what you use and I'll emulate it, and put in that thing that you've always wanted! Email me at steeven.liu2@gmail.com.

### I want to get started building an organisation app and google led me here.
I'd love for you to join the project! I know coding your own from scratch is fun but if nothing else, give Polymorph a run for its money. You can access it here, on github: [acenturyandabit.github.io/polymorph/](https://acenturyandabit.github.io/polymorph/)

### I want to help with a new project to get my foot in the door to the software industry.
The issues page is waiting for you! Most of the tasks are optimisation tasks - trails from features i've implemented but haven't quite cleaned up yet. If you want to make a new feature or anything else, you can get in touch via email or just go for it! It's open source, it's your project now :)

### Wow, I think an interface designed on the basis that you should fill your screen with functional components is great!
I know right? How come noone else has thought of this yet?

## Documentation
I uh, should get to that. There are a trove of examples in /operators/, including `template.js` and `referenc.js`, but they may not be up to date. To really see how I get around polymorph as a developer, check out itemlist.js. If you have any recommendations, send me an email :3

Happy creating!
