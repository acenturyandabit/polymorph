## Problem
I like to rehash my task management tools as things come up - if I decide that there's a better way of managing my tasks that works for ME, then I want to be able to rebuild it. Sound familiar? I bet every developer or aspiring developer has a task management system that they've built or contributed to before because it just 'isn't quite right for them'.

## Solution
Polymorph provides you with elements such as lists, drilldowns, and graphs, in a highly space-efficient organisation framework where the screen is split into functional rectangular areas. Tabs are used to provide quick configuration options and provide flexibility. A script runner element allows you to automate parts of your workflow such as time logging and organisation.

This highly modular approach allows you to take charge of your task organisation in a way that no other platform will allow (apart from building up a task management app yourself from scratch, that is.)

## Keeping it straight
Polymorph doesn't use React or Angular or Vue. This means that anyone who knows javascript can contribute; there are no dependencies to install; and code isn't obfuscated*, meaning you can edit it during runtime from the browser.

Polymorph doesn't need to run on a server, just a browser; and Polymorph will be always open source. This means anyone can fork, clone and edit, and mod to their heart's content. 

*: Code is concatenated instead of compiled for deployment, which prevents multiple source downloads, often a bigger load-time-killer than download. 

## Contributing
See the issues list! I fix most of my own issues because Polymorph is my day-to-day, but there's always nice-to-haves.

### Apps I admire and have copied
- Workflowy: [https://workflowy.com/] - use the workflowish operator in Polymorph for this; I think the keybindings are the same.
