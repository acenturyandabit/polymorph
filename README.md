## Problem
I like to rehash my task management tools as things come up - if I decide that there's a better way of managing my tasks that works for ME, then I want to be able to rebuild it. Sound familiar? I bet every developer or aspiring developer has a task management system that they've built or contributed to before because it just 'isn't quite right for them'.

## Solution
Polymorph's edge is more about what it doesn't have than what it does: 
- Polymorph doesn't use React or Angular or Vue. This means that anyone who knows javascript can contribute; there are no dependencies to install; and code isn't obfuscated, meaning you can edit it during runtime from the browser.
- Polymorph doesn't need to run on a server; and Polymorph will be always open source. This means anyone can fork, clone and edit, and mod to their heart's content. 

Naturally there are costs to not using a 'modern' development system, but these are forgone in the hopes that Polymorph's value as a customisable task management system is realised for as many people as possible. 

## Additional quirks
On top of its moddability, Polymorph also has a reconfigurable user interface (as you might have noted in the GIF). This makes it flexible for other uses such as as a note-taking tool, brainstorming tool, or whatever use you may have for it.
## The ask
Your contributions are welcome! I'll try and keep a live issues page open.

If you want to try Polymorph and discover that you like it overall except for one little thing, then please email me! 

Or, if you are using another todo list app that you love and want a base from which to mod it, feel free to take this as a starting point. Here's the documentation:

### Apps I admire and have copied
- Workflowy: [https://workflowy.com/] - use the workflowish operator in Polymorph for this; I think the keybindings are the same.
